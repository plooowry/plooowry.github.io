            <h2>ABOUT</h2>
            <p>
                My career sits at the unique intersection of diplomacy, national security, and engineering. Currently, I represent the UK's technical interests as a Diplomat within the UK's Joint Delegation to NATO, where I navigate high-level multilateral discussions and act as the lead project manager on the nuclear portfolio. In this role, I leverage rigorous data analysis to inform the UK's perspective and translate complex technical deliberations into clear, actionable insights for senior officials.
            </p>
            <p>
                This focus on data has been a consistent thread throughout my career. In previous roles as an Analyst for the Ministry of Defence, I employed advanced analytical tools to process vast quantities of data, led interdisciplinary teams of intelligence experts and data scientists, and utilised cutting-edge visualisation to tell compelling 'data stories'. This practical experience is built on a foundation of Mechanical Engineering and is now being sharpened with a Professional Certificate in Machine Learning and AI from Imperial College London.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am driven to apply my unique blend of experience—from systems engineering and crisis management to international policy negotiation—to the complex challenges and societal impacts of artificial intelligence. My goal is to use an evidence-based, analytical approach to ensure emerging technologies are understood and integrated responsibly.
